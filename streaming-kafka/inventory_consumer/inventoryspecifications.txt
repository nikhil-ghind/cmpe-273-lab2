-python program that starts up a Kafka consumer in the "inventory-service-group" consumer group
-the program consumes OrderPlaced events from the "orders" topic
-when the program receives an OrderPlaced event it reserves inventory and produces an InventoryReserved or InventoryFailed event to the "inventory-events" topic
-the program must be idempotent: if the same orderId is received more than once it skips processing and does not double reserve
-the program must be able to handle an input argument INVENTORY_FAIL_RATE to inject a percentage of failures for testing
-the program must be able to handle an input argument CONSUMER_THROTTLE_MS to add artificial delay per message in order to demonstrate consumer lag
