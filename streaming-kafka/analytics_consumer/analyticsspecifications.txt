-python program that starts up a Kafka consumer in the "analytics-group" consumer group and a FastAPI server on port 8002
-the program consumes events from both the "orders" and "inventory-events" topics
-the program computes orders per minute (bucketed by event createdAt time) and failure rate (failed / total reservations)
-the program periodically prints metrics to stdout and writes them to a metrics.txt file
-when the program receives a POST /replay call it resets consumer group offsets to the beginning and recomputes all metrics from scratch
-when the program receives a GET /metrics call it returns the current metrics as JSON
